A work in progress at the moment.
Currently it is using the OpenTK framework for game libraries, openGL and input

What Works:
\t Launcher (although currently the launcher is being bypassed for development's sake; it was a pain everytime I needed to debug the game)
\t Loading Screen (because you HAVE TO have one to be a legit thing).

What Doesn't Work:
\t Everything in game (including singleplayer and multiplayer)
\t Level Loading
\t Options Menu

What's in the Works:
\t Main Menu (got the buttons, just gotta start making them do stuff. Not sure if I want to have the panorama BG).
\t Network Framework (Have user authentication, and...that's it. Sorta have the keepAlive but that's returning an error for some reason).

Build Status: Pre-Alpha
Build State: Builds
Current Hurdle: laying out the base framework for the in game rendering. If you can lend any help with this I would love it =)
