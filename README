A work in progress at the moment.
Still trying to finish up the underlying framework.
Currently it is using the XNA 3.1 framework for the game-side of it (updated version may remove this for a proprietary framework).

Build Status: Pre-Alpha
Build State: Builds
Current Hurdle: Client-Server communications.
	Right now I am still researching the connection between the client and a minecraft server. Any insight to this that you can bring would be much appreciated.
