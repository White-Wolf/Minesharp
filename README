A work in progress at the moment.
Currently it is using the OpenTK framework for game libraries, openGL and input

What Works:
 * Launcher (although currently the launcher is being bypassed for development's sake; it was a pain everytime I needed to debug the game)
 * Loading Screen (because you HAVE TO have one to be a legit thing).

What Doesn't Work:
 * Everything in game (including singleplayer and multiplayer)
 * Level Loading
 * Options Menu

What's in the Works:
 * Main Menu (got the buttons, just gotta start making them do stuff. Not sure if I want to have the panorama BG).
 * Network Framework (Have user authentication, and...that's it. Sorta have the keepAlive but that's returning an error for some reason).

Build Status: Pre-Alpha
Build State: Builds
Current Hurdle: laying out the base framework for the in game rendering. If you can lend any help with this I would love it =)

We are now using the AssortedWidgets code by BillConan Studio for UIs.
